# zAppz

Some work done under vanilla JS and trying to keep frameworks to a minimum.

## Getting Started
1 - clone the repo__
2 - npm install__
3 - grunt serve

## Documentation
At the moment you'll find the following context:
- rendering js files on demand thanks to promises and fileFlix.js, a small function done for this purpose
- rendering html on demand, also thanks to promises and a small templating file created with this on mind
- a fancy animation with a cube!
- router is in progress (just starting actually)

Grunt is there to produce a local server. No time was invested in the server part and as just mainly imported from another project :)

## Examples
